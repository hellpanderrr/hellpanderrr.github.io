# Issues

Findings that outlived the session in which they were discovered. IDs are
stable and never renumbered; fixed rows stay, with `Status: FIXED` and the
evidence that closed them.

Totals: 7 open, 6 fixed (13 total).

## M-001 — Morpheus accented form keeps the `,lemma` suffix
**Status: FIXED** (2026-08-05, engine `797f779` / site `1cb1771`)
`parseAnalysisLine` stored `currito_,curro` as the accented form instead of
`currito_`. Python reference strips it (`postags.py:434-436`). Corrupted DP
alignment for every out-of-wordlist word on return visits.

## M-002 — `addEntry` left a stale `entriesCache`
**Status: FIXED** (2026-08-05, same commits)
`ensureAnalyzed` cached the empty lookup for a missing word; the Morpheus row
written immediately after was invisible to `getAccents`, which fell through to
the `tag_to_endings` heuristic. Broke first visits: `currito` → `currītō`.

## M-003 — Scansion feet vanish when a line number trails the line
**Status: FIXED** (2026-08-05, site `fe9081b`)
The `.verse-foot` span was only created when `scannedFeet[lineIdx]` was
truthy; an empty string rendered nothing, so unmetered lines looked broken.
Now the span always renders, showing a muted `—` placeholder via a new
`.verse-foot.no-scan` class. Same commit also fixed the wider scansion
story: `macrons.txt` had `italorum` with a short initial `I^`, but the
hendecasyllable's fixed-long position 8 requires `Ītalōrum`. The fix is a
JS `ACCENT_OVERRIDES` map in the engine (`e7fb22a`) carrying both readings,
not a one-off wordlist edit (the 33MB file is regenerated upstream).

## M-004 — Output is not editable
**Status: OPEN.** Adoption blocker per r/latin feedback: users macronize to
catch typos and normalize spellings (`-īs` → `-ēs`) and cannot correct the
result. Winge's original site made the output `contenteditable` in May 2017
plus per-vowel click-to-toggle. Substantial build: contenteditable +
re-macronize + re-export + surviving the cycle/click handlers.

## M-005 — Word popup shows no dictionary definition
**Status: OPEN.** Users cannot tell *populus* (people) from *populus* (poplar),
or the two *malus* lemmas, from the readings list alone. Add a dictionary link
per reading — `accentedSources` already carries lemma+tag per row.

## M-006 — Popup buries the useful section under debug detail
**Status: OPEN.** r/latin feedback: "Possible readings" is the only part users
want; the RFTagger/Morpheus detail reads as debug output. Move readings to the
top, collapse the rest behind `<details>`. Also the heading is misleading — it
lists *distinct macronizations*, not all morphological readings (readings that
differ only in a short vowel collapse into one row).

## M-007 — Individual words/lines cannot be selected or copied
**Status: OPEN.** Only the bulk "copy" button works. Structural: words render
via `<span class="ipa" content="…">` painted with CSS `attr(content)`, so the
selectable text is empty, and the popup/cycle handlers own the click.

## M-008 — `rftagger.js` ships an assertions (debug) build
**Status: OPEN.** CodeRabbit finding on PR #7. `assert()` bodies,
`checkStackCookie`, `runtimeDebug` and the missing/unexported symbol tables are
all present, unlike the release-style `cruncher.js` beside it. Inflates the
one-time download and keeps assertions on hot paths. Fix belongs in the engine
repo's build, then re-sync `dist/`.

## M-009 — Deployed WASM assets are untracked
**Status: OPEN.** `macronizer/wasm/cruncher.*` is untracked (not ignored), so
the bytes actually served have no verifiable provenance. Commit them, or record
the build SHA that produced them.

## M-010 — Word popup showed "Wordlist: Found" for Morpheus-rescued words
**Status: FIXED** (2026-08-05, site `fe9081b`)
`currito`/`diffregit` aren't in `macrons.txt` but the popup said "Found".
`getAllEntries` merges Morpheus extras into wordlist hits, so `isUnknown`
stayed false. Fixed by keying the label on `token.morpheusAnalyzed` —
extras only ever exist for file-absent words — showing "Not found — via
Morpheus" instead.

## M-011 — Duplicate Morpheus rows in the word popup
**Status: FIXED** (2026-08-05, site `fe9081b`)
Morpheus emits the same parse across case-variant runs, and the popup
rendered them raw. Deduplicated in `macronizer.html` keyed on
lemma+accented+rendered-features (comparing `formInfo` objects failed —
their conditional fields differ in structure).

## M-012 — RFTagger POS silently contradicted the selected reading
**Status: FIXED** (2026-08-05, site `fe9081b`)
`currito` tagged `d--------` (adverb) but read as a verb. The popup now
compares the RFTagger POS against the active reading's POS and shows a
note when they disagree.

## M-013 — Scansion wordlist-gap miner + corpus (found, not fixed)
**Status: OPEN** (engine `e7fb22a` added the tooling)
`test/miner-scansion.mjs` + `test/data/corpus/` feed Aeneid 1–6 + Catullus
(5,507 lines) through the macronizer and flag lines whose scansion returns
empty — the italorum signature. **176 lines flagged** (~130 hexameter, ~46
Catullus). Buckets: Greek names/proper nouns (engine limitation), known
ambiguous/enclitic forms (`unius`, `-ne` enclitics — candidate gaps), and
common-word lines that still fail (Catullus 13.11 `nam unguentum dabo`
suggests an automaton strictness issue, not a data gap). Needs Phase 2:
confirm each against Pedecerto to separate real gaps from engine limits.
